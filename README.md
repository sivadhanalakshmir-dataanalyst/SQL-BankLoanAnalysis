This project analyzes bank loan data to derive actionable insights using SQL queries. Below are the key performance indicators (KPIs) explored:


* KPI 1-Year Wise Loan Amount Status:

  ~ Analyzed loan amounts over different years ranging from 2007 to 2011 to understand trends and patterns in loan disbursement and status.
  

* KPI 2- Grade and Subgrade Wise revol_bal:

 ~ Examined revolving balances for different loan grades and subgrades categorised from A-G to assess credit utilization and risk.
  

* KPI 3- Total Payment for verified status Vs Total payment for non-verified status:

  ~ Compared total payments made for verified and non-verified loan statuses to evaluate payment behavior and verification impact.
  

* KPI 4- State Wise Loan Status:

  ~ Investigated loan statuses across different states to identify regions with high default rates or repayment issues.
  

* KPI 5- Home Ownership Vs Last Payment Date Stats:

  ~ Explored statistics related to the last payment dates based on home ownership status to understand payment trends among homeowners and renters.



Through this analysis, valuable insights were gained to aid in decision-making related to loan disbursement, risk assessment, and customer segmentation.
