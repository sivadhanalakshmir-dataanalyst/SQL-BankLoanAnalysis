* Grade and Subgrade Wise revol_bal: Examined revolving balances for different loan grades and subgrades to assess credit utilization and risk.
  
* Total Payment for verified status Vs Total payment for non-verified status: Compared total payments made for verified and non-verified loan statuses to evaluate payment behavior and verification impact.
  
* State Wise Loan Status: Investigated loan statuses across different states to identify regions with high default rates or repayment issues.
  
* Home Ownership Vs Last Payment Date Stats: Explored statistics related to the last payment dates based on home ownership status to understand payment trends among homeowners and renters.
